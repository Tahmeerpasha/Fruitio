# Fruitio
The movie recommendation system for dbms mini project.
 Fruitio is a movie recommendation system that stores detailed information about films, 
including the name, ID, actor name, director name, year of release, language of the movie, genre, 
poster, and rating. The system has two user interfaces; one for the admin and the other for the 
user. The admin interface allows for the management of movie information, including the 
addition, deletion, and modification of movies and their details. Fruitio is designed to provide 
recommendations to users based on various search parameters. By providing four basic details 
such as genre, language, year of release, and rating, the user will receive personalized movie 
recommendations. The system is built using HTML, CSS as front-end technologies and PHP 
MyAdmin as a database. PHP is used as a server-side language to perform queries.
